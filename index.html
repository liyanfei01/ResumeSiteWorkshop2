        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <img class="avatar" src="https://i.imgur.com/T4EpAg6.png" />
        <p>
          I was born in China, I grew up in Brazil and I live in Chicago for
          over 15 years. I'm a user-centered designer, focused on creating
          strategic solutions with the purpose of helping eliminate product and
          services pain-points.  This admiration for user experience branched
          from an architecture background, which taught me the core principles
          of designing for the client. From here, my empathetic personality and
          critical thinking drove me to the UXUI design immersive course at
          Ironhack SP. The 10-week Bootcamp helped refine my skills further as
          well as fueling my ambition to search for a UX Design role. ​ In my
          next role, I want to be involved in user experience design for the
          retail & hospitality industry, in a multidisciplinary team, remote or
          flexible.
